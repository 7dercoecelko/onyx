Powerful framework for modern applications.

## About üëã

Onyx Framework is a powerful general purpose framework for [Crystal language](https://crystal-lang.org/). It has the following goals:

* **Joy** for newcomers, yet an ability to scale with the developer's knowledge
* **Type-safety** on top of Crystal's amazing built-in type system
* **Performance** having minimum possible overhead

The framework consists of the following loosely coupled components:

* [Onyx::HTTP](https://github.com/onyxframework/http) to build scalable web applications
* [Onyx::SQL](https://github.com/onyxframework/sql) to add SQL models to your business layer
* [Onyx::EDA](https://github.com/onyxframework/eda) to implement events-based reactivity

## Supporters üïä
